  Things that worked as expected:

 .  The preprocessor -- I just copied from System.Directory and everything
    worked as expected.

 .  The foreign imports.

  Things that I had to adjust:

 .  When importing Windows library functions, you need to use `stdcall` and
    `ccall` -- the calling convention is different for Windows.

 .  When specifying a library, it is no good to use the names given on MSDN,
    because GHC ships with GCC and a bunch of GNU-ified Windows libs. I ended
    up using `rpcrt4` instead of `Rpcrt4.lib`, for example.

  Things that were simpler than expected:

 .  I did not need to inclue any header files at all.
